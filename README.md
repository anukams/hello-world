# About my first project on GitHub
The original JQuery Organisation Chart Plugin.

IMPORTANT! This project has been superceded by the react-org-chart project.

This is a small JQuery plugin that generates a hierarchical orginisational chart from a nested unordered list.

HTML/CSS purists likely would not be happy with this since it uses nested tables to achieve the layout. Nevertheless, it works pretty well and you can make nice looking interactive organisational charts with it quite easily.

This has been tested on Firefox and Chrome on Linux, and Firefox and Chrome on Windows. It also works on IE8, but due to the deficient CSS support in that broken browser the chart looks quite basic.
